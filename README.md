# Major Project on Medical Insurance Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate, efficient, and data-driven model that can predict medical insurance premiums based on various personal, health, and lifestyle factors. 

## Attribute Information :

**Age** - The age of the customer<br/>
**Sex** - Gender of the customer (male or female)</br>
**BMI** - Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on height and weight</br>
**Children** - No. of children/dependents covered under the insurance policy</br>
**Smoker** - Smoking status of the customer</br>
**Region** - Geographic region of the customer</br>
**Charges** - Medical insurance premium charged to the customer</br>

## Conclusion :

**The following are some conclusions that can be drawn from the graphs as mentioned in Figure 3:**</br>

a. The charges are higher for Males as compared to Females, but the difference is not much. Hence, we can say approximate equal charges for both the genders.</br>
b. The charges are nearly uniform across the four specified Regions.</br>
c. **<i>The premium imposed on Smokers is thrice than that for non-smokers.</i>**</br>
