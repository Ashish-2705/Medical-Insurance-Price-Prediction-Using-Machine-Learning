# Major Project on Medical Insurance Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate, efficient, and data-driven model that can predict medical insurance premiums based on various personal, health, and lifestyle factors. The project follows a structured approach to developing an accurate and efficient machine learning model for predicting medical insurance premiums. It involves data collection, preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and deployment to ensure reliability and practical applicability.

By leveraging historical data and advanced algorithms, ML models can identify key factors influencing insurance costs such as <i>**age, BMI, smoking status, medical history, and geographic location**</i>.

## Attribute Information :

**Age** - The age of the customer<br/>
**Sex** - Gender of the customer (male or female)</br>
**BMI** - Body Mass Index, measure of body fat based on height and weight</br>
**Children** - No. of children/dependents covered under the insurance policy</br>
**Smoker** - Smoking status of the customer</br>
**Region** - Geographic region of the customer</br>
**Charges** - Medical insurance premium charged to the customer</br>

## Conclusion :

**The following are some conclusions that can be drawn from the graphs as mentioned in Figure 3:** </br>

a. The charges are higher for Males as compared to Females, but the difference is not much. Hence, we can say approximate equal charges for both the genders.</br>
b. The charges are nearly uniform across the four specified Regions.</br>
c. **<i>The premium imposed on Smokers is thrice than that for non-smokers.</i>**</br>
